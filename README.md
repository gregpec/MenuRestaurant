# MenuRestaurant
This is my project in C# for the Certificate of Completion of the Basic Course conducted by Adam Kamizelich. 
The main idea of the project is to build an electronic traveler's culinary diary. The customer can add restaurant ratings and the program will save them in various files. 
The file name consists of the name of the restaurant and the city visited. You can add ratings in several ways:
1. as a decimal number (range from 1 to 6), e.g.: 2.5, 3.75, etc.
2. as an integer with the signs "+" and "-" (range also from 1 to 6), e.g.: 3+, +3, -3, 3-.
3. as English letters A to F.
The program checks all these ratings, validates them and, after converting them to appropriate decimal numbers, saves them in the appropriate file.
